## Description

As a busy boot-camp student, I want an application in which I can write and save notes so that I can organize my ideas and keep track of tasks that need to be completed. 

I used express.js to build this app. In order to properly parse 

I used this project as an opportunity to practice modular routing. I organized my files into separate directories and used module.export and const/require as needed to access necessary files. I ran into some challenges getting my router to function properly, but after some debugging discovered the typos that were the source of my errors and corrected them. 

I also looked up and used an npm that generates a unique identifier for each object in the db. It was excellent practice figuring out how to install and use just by reading the documentation provided.

## Installation

No installation required for this application.

## Usage

When you first navigate to the application, you will be directed to a page with a "get started" button. Click the button to navigate to the notes-taking page. Existing notes will display in the column on the lefthand side of the screen, and the righthand column is where you will type to add new notes. 

Click on a note title from the lefthand column to view the note text in full on the righthand side. 

Click on the plus sign in the upper right corner to start a new note. 

Click on the "Note Title" text area to begin entering your note. A save icon (floppy disk) will appear in the upper righthand corner of the page once you have entered some text into the note text area. When you are finished adding text, click the save icon to add your new note.

To delete a note, click the delete icon (red trash can) to delete a note from the lefthand column.

See demo below for functionality:
